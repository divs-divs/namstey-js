Javascript is synchronous single threaded language.
// Async - Async is a keyword that transforms the normal function into the asyn function that will always return a Promise
Await - Await is a keyword that waits for the promise to be executed and it can onlly be used inside the async functions.

Async and await generally being used to handlle the promises.

We kknow that JS is synchronous singlle thhreaded language but to make it behave llike asynchronous llangugage
3 concepts came into picture.

 1. Event loop
 2. CCallback Queue
 3. call stack with global Execution context
 
1.Callback - callback hell structure also known as pyramid of doom
  -- Issues with calllback 
     1. Callback hell
     2. Inversion control.(we loose the control on the code)
      ex- function createorder(cart,function(){
        makePayment()
      })
      - show we dont know when the createOrder api will execute successfully or it will execute or not.
2.promises - came into picture to avoid callback hell 
3.Async/await - came into picture to avoid promise chaining


Async and await are the features in javascript that helps us t work withh asynchronoous ccode and make them readadlle and
allsoo easy to manage.

Asyncc functiions are the special functions that allways returns promise and inside the async function
you can use the await kkeywrd to pause the excutionnn until the promise iis settledd.
